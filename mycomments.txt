How I created the app:

Basics
1) Create blank Django Project in VS
2) Use Virtual Environment (Solutions Explorer -> Right Click on Pyth Env)
3) Test if it works properly: in cmd do "python manage.py runserver (opt: port)"; in VS Ctrl+F5 works instead
4) Create an app: in cmd do "python manage.py startapp <app name>"; in VS I had to use the Solution Explorer to add it
5) This creates a folder with the app name. Note: manage.py, <app name> Folder and Django folder should be in the same directory
6) in views.py added "from django.http import HttpResponse" to serve HTTP Requests on the functions defined
7) Define Functions for each View
8) in <app name>\urls.py we have to add redirects: "from django.urls import path, from . import views" urlpatterns = [ path()] etc
9) settings.py add our appname under INSTALLED_APPS
10) in the base url.py add , ""include" to imports, add the paths for the url
