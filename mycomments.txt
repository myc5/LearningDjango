How I created the app:

Basics
1) Create blank Django Project in VS
2) Use Virtual Environment (Solutions Explorer -> Right Click on Pyth Env)
3) Test if it works properly: in cmd do "python manage.py runserver (opt: port)"; in VS Ctrl+F5 works instead
4) Create an app: in cmd do "python manage.py startapp <app name>"; in VS I had to use the Solution Explorer to add it
5) This creates a folder with the app name. Note: manage.py, <app name> Folder and Django folder should be in the same directory
6) in views.py added "from django.http import HttpResponse" to serve HTTP Requests on the functions defined
7) Define Functions for each View
8) in <app name>\urls.py we have to add redirects: "from django.urls import path, from . import views" urlpatterns = [ path()] etc
9) settings.py add our appname under INSTALLED_APPS
10) in the base url.py add ", include" to imports, add the paths for the url

Migrating
In the CMD line: "python manage.py makemigrations, then "python manage.py migrate"
This does not work in Visual Studio (non-Code, that is), and needs to be done via right click on  -> Python -> Django

DBs
In models.py add the classes, can inherit from imported Django Models
- After adding the models, remember to migrate the changes via "python manage.py makemigrations <app name>" & migrate command


Data

Hiding the SECRET_KEY on GitHub:
- Not sharing the SECRET_KEY in settings.py is a given if uploading to GitHub *and* intending to run it pubicly. 
How to: 
1) create .env file in the same folder as manage.py, *cut* content SECRET KEY = "<key" from settings.py
2) create .gitignore, content ".env"
3) in settings.py: from decouple import config SECRET_KEY = config("SECRET_KEY")
4) install and add modules to requirements as such:
pip install python-decouple
pip freeze > requirements.txt
VS can update requirements.txt via right click
